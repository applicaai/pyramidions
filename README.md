This repository contains a demonstrative implementation for pooling-based models, e.g., DeepPyramidion
complementing our paper: `Sparsifying Transformer Models with Trainable Representation Pooling`. 


[Our Paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05169)

The detailed README on how to use it is provided in [examples](./fairseq/examples/deep_pyramidion/README.md).
